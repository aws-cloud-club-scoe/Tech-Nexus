# Summary

An in-depth analysis of the October 20, 2025 outage, which began with a single DNS issue in US-EAST-1 and cascaded into a 15-hour global internet disruption. This event exposes the critical vulnerabilities that "big tech" companies face when relying on concentrated, single-region deployments for their core infrastructure.

## Key Insights

This article explores how widespread connectivity failures impact cloud systems and provides actionable insights for designing fault-tolerant architectures, implementing multi-region redundancy, and improving incident response procedures across cloud infrastructure. It reveals the dangers of over-reliance on single-region deployments and the importance of geographic distribution in critical systems.
